<h3>Taare zameem par</h3>
<p>It explores the life and imagination of Ishaan (Safary), an artistically gifted 8-year-old boy whose poor academic<br> 
    performance leads his parents to send him to a boarding school, where a new art teacher Nikumbh (Khan) suspects <br> 
    that he is dyslexic and helps him to overcome his reading disorder. The film focuses on raising awareness about autism<br>
    and psychiatric disability in children.</p>
<h3>The Pursuit of happiness</h3>
<p>It is based on Gardner's nearly one-year struggle being homeless.[2] The unusual spelling of the film's title comes <br>
   from a mural that Gardner sees on the wall outside the daycare facility his son attended.</p>
